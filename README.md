# Web-Game-Project-MSP1

## Main Goal

An interactive online web game users can explore a 2D (pixel) world and collect/upgrade weapons and pass through a platform style map.

### Project Requirements

- This is a solo project
- This game cannot be a game or assignment we've already done in class
- This game must run in a web browser
- This game must be tracked in Github, with a minimum on 10 commits
- Ideally, put your empty project up on Github on day one of development and aim for multiple commits per day
- This game must be deployed on Github Pages or another location

### Game Requirements

- This game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or 1 player (PvE)
- The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI
- For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players
- This game should be winnable or it should keep score (whichever makes more sense)
- When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts
- If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should live in separate files
- Effort must be spent on styling and appearance
- The HTML code should use sematic tags
- The game should have a Readme.md file in the Github repository that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality

### Functional Pieces

- User must be able to have a first weapon pick (all of them being swords/sticks)
- User should be able to solve puzzle maps to get to new weapon (weapons are just collectables)
- User would have a set timer to complete the level

### Styling Ideas

- Use applicable CSS color backgrounds then add 2D image on top
- On completion of level create a continue pop up and use CSS to make it have the same design as the level
- Visuals/Transitions for when completing the level (not just a loading black screen)
- Create weaponry menu to look at upgraded items style with CSS create a button function
  - Can only carry Sword, Armor, Helmet in inventory.
